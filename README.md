This project aims at Portlet unit testing. It's compactible with JSR168 and JSR286.

One of the shortcomings now is that you need to set the init-parameters in the portlet.xml file to initialize your portlet object. But it will be done automatically by specifying the corresponding file in the future.

Another shortcoming is that it doesn't support filter testing yet. And it's also in the future implementation plan.
